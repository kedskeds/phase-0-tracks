# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a way of keeping track of changes to a codebase. It's useful because it allows developers to recover earlier versions of the code if a bug is found or a mistake is made.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of a repository. It essentially allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously. You would use a branch for efficiency purposes, and to preserve the integrity of the code in the master branch. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point. It takes files that have been edited and saves them to the repo's history. A good commit message is succinct, descriptive, and written consistently.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when two branches have modified the same lines of code, or one branch contains edits to a file that was deleted in another branch. Either way, Git is confused and the user has to manually resolve the conflict.
