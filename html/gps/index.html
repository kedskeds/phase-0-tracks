		1. what is the purpose of html semantic tags?
		The purpose is to provide meaning to parts of a page. It is helpful mainly to people who are differently abled and need to use the screenreader function to navigate a site. The most useful tags are probably main & aside (to highglight the most important and least important parts of a page).

		2. What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
		The order that the elements are displayed in is the order that they're written in within the HTML doc, unless CSS styling or JS functions dictate otherwise.

		3. What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
		The snippet function was new to me. I will definitely create more snippets, like a general table template, to speed things up when I'm coding.

		4. What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
		The use of certain semantic tags is still something i need to brush up on. I can improve my understanding by referring to cheat sheets and adding mroe semantic tags to my personal site just to get a feel for where they should go.
