Plan for tackling JQuery (2 hrs):

Useful Resources: W3Schools, cheat sheets, and JQuery documentation. I think my strategy most of the time is to Google something like "JQuery quick start guide" or "JQuery beginner basics" just so I can get up and running quickly.

I like to stop and test myself frequently in the beginning to make sure I'm understanding what I'm reading (every 10-15 minutes or so). If things are making sense, I'll test myself less frequently and spend more time reading & absorbing.

When diving into something new, sometimes it helps to just power through rather than taking a break every 25 minutes. I think I'll try for a double pomodoro (break every 50 minutes), just so I can clear my head a couple times.

============================

Strategies that were the most effective:

Under normal circumstances, I probably would have worked through a tutorial to learn a new language, but I figured that might take too long. Instead I went straight to the documentation to look for some kind of quick start guide, and found a link to the "JQuery Learning Center". This turned out to be a valuable resource that I stuck with for almost the full 2 hours. The Learning Center's guide was not highly technical and I could jump around between topics. 

I stopped & tested myself less frequently as time went on. The only time I deviated from my plan was to stop for a break earlier than I had expected. 50 minutes was a little too long to keep my attention focused. 

In summary, the most effective strategies for me were:
- finding a good beginner guide
- taking frequent breaks
